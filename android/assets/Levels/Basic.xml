    <EntryMessage>You clamber into the chamber, wrinkling your nose at the sour stench of damp. Water drips from the ceiling, echoing ominously around the cold stone walls.</EntryMessage>

    <DefeatMessage>You lose, dieing a dogs death. Your body collapsed and discarded on the floor, to become the food of the native rat population.</DefeatMessage>
